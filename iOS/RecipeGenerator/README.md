RecipeGenerator Example
===

This example illustrates how to use [constrained generation](https://leap.liquid.ai/docs/edge-sdk/ios/constrained-generation)
feature provided by LeapSDK. The project is managed with XcodeGen.

## Build
First of all, download LFM2 1.2B model bundle from [Leap Model Library](https://leap.liquid.ai)
and store it in `Resources` directory.

Then use [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to create the XCode project files:
```
$ xcodegen
```

Finally, open the XCode project and build it.
